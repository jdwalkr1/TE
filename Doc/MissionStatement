Our project aims to provide users with an easily accessible text editor in the Java computing
language.
Our goal is to provide users with tools to make editing and writing texts easier and efficient.
We aim to achieve this through adding the features we believe are most beneficial to our users.
As members of the open source community, we are committed to a spirit of collaboration and mutual
contribution.
Our target audience is anyone who writes texts or code every day.
